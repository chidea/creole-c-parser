= Indented Blocks

Blocks may be indented:
: 1st level of indentation
with more text
on lines following.

Next Block.

: Again 1st level.
: Followed by next block, same level.
::: Now at 3rd level.
:: And back
to 2nd level.
: And again 1st level.

Quoted material may also:
> Come at 1st level.
>>>> Or at 4th level.
>>>>>> Or at 6th level.
>>> Or at
3rd level, spanning
lines.
>>> Still at 3rd.

We may mix
: indented
> and quoted 
:: matrial
>>> at different
::: levels,
: but is this pretty?
