= Escape Character

~ is the escape character. It allows to escape ~**, ~//
or free links like ~http://www.foo.com/ or ~www.foo.com.

Note that ~ftp://ftp.foo.org/ does not start italics.

It is let alone at end of line ~
or if a space follows, like in ~ this sample.

A tilde escapes itself ~~ like here.

~*** boldness **  is still here because we used {{{~***}}}
which only escapes the first *.


~* List or
~| table chars may also be escaped.

~ is not escaping in nowiki like {{{~** here ~//}}} or
{{{
~** here ~//
}}}

Neither in plugin text like <<@ ~** this one>>.
